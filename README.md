# This is the readme file for the Button clicker 

<p>Practice to get used to javascript including what we have learn so far about html and css</p>
<p>Spent 6 hours in this practice, trying to create the functions without modifying the html code, at the end was succesfull and I'm very happy with the result.</p>
